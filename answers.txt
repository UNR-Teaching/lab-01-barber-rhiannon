LAB QUESTIONS 

Question One:

The ls > newfile.txt outputs the result of the command to the file created. I am gathering that the '>' works as an insertion operator. 

Question Two:

The git status says that the file "newfile.txt" has changes that will be commited. 

Question Three: 

The git diff command tells what has been changed within the contents of the file. In this case, it tells the lines added.
